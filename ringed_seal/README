CONTENTS:

"RUN.R"
	- R script that runs the entire analysis.

"ringed_seal_data"
	- contains all data files needed to run the model.

"ringed_seal_code"
	- contains all code files needed to process data, fit the model, and analyze the results.

"ringed_seal_results"
	- output directory where results (posterior samples, estimates, plots etc.) are saved.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: create a root directory

Step 2: ensure your root directory contains the three folders: (1) "ringed_seal_code", (2) "ringed_seal_data" and (3) "ringed_seal_results". The folders should be set up as follows.

- Root directory
	- ringed_seal_code
		- analysis
		- data_processing
		- functions
		- sensitivity_analyses
	- ringed_seal_data
		- model_data
		- source_data
			- raw_data
				- Finland
				- Sweden
				- Ice
	- ringed_seal_results
		- plots
		- sensitivities

The contents of these folders should remain unchanged from their original downloaded state.

To perform all analyses, simply run the R script "RUN.R". Note that this may take 10-20 hours. To run individual analyses separately, see detailed instructions in steps 3-4 below.

Step 3: Within the ".../ringed_seal_code/" folder, run the three R scripts below in the following order:
	1. "process_data.R"
	2. "fit_model.R"
	3. "get_results.R"

Step 4: To fit alternative models and run sensitivity analyses, run the following R scripts in the given order:
	1. "fit_data_sensitivities.R"
	2. "fit_model_sensitivities.R"
	3. "get_sensitivity_results.R"
