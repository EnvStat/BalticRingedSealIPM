"generate_outputs.R"
	R scripts that extracts posterior samples of model parameters 
	and outputs most of the results and plots used in the manuscript
	into the folder ".../ringed_seal_results/".

"post_pred_checks.R"
	R script that generates plots of posterior predictive checks and
	outputs them into ".../ringed_seal_results/plots/".

"critical_hunting.R"
	R script that generates Figure 7a in the manuscript and prints the
	posterior quantiles for the "critical hunting level" in 2023.

"scenario_predict.R"
	R script that generates Figure 7b in the manuscript.

"PSIS.R"
	R script that computes loo-cv using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling for models
	fitted to each data subset, and outputs the results into the subfolders in ".../ringed_seal_results/sensitivities/".

"prior_vs_posterior.R"
	R script that generates prior-posterior comparison plots, as well as prior-posterior and 
	posterior-posterior overlaps, and outputs the results into ".../ringed_seal_results/sensitivities/prior_posterior/".

"predict_hunting_effort.R"
	R script that generates plots of out-of-sample predictions of the distribution of harvests throughout each hunting season, and compares it to the observed data distribution, and outputs the plots into ".../ringed_seal_results/plots/".
