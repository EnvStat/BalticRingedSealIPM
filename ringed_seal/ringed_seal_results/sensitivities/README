This folder contains outputs from all alternative models and sensitivities. Below are descriptions of each model.

1: Thinned aerial survey data
2: Pre-2012 aerial survey data
3: Post-2012 aerial survey data
4: Thinned reproduction data
5: Post-2007 reproduction data
6: Thinned harvest totals
7: Thinned dead sample data
m1: simpler alternative to haul out probability model
m2: prior sensitivity for the baseline haul out probability parameter, w (left shifted)
m3: prior sensitivity for the baseline haul out probability parameter, w (right shifted)
